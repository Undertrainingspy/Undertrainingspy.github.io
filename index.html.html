    <h1>What are Bomb Cyclones</h1>

    <p>
      For this topic of the assignment, I chose an article from Reuters by <strong>Will Dunham</strong>. This article delves into the concept of <strong>bomb cyclones</strong>, a powerful weather phenomenon with the potential to cause significant damage. According to the 
      <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/what-are-bomb-cyclones-how-do-they-form-2024-11-29/">article</a>, 
      bomb cyclones are mid-latitude cyclones that rapidly intensify, creating hurricane-force winds, heavy precipitation, and severe weather conditions.
      These storms are particularly common during the cold season and are fueled by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic conditions, such as a strong jet stream and warm ocean surfaces.
